| all bold and italic | `*** ***` or `___ ___` | `***This text is super important!***` | ***This text is super important!*** |

## Blockquote
---
Start off a blockquote with a greater-than sign (>).

<u>Example:</u>
This is normal text
> This is a quote
```markdown
This is normal text
> This is a quote
```

## Code
---
### Inline code
To render inline code, surround snippets of code with backticks (&grave; &grave;).

<u>Example:</u>
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

### Codeblock
For multi-line code snippets, create a codeblock with triple-backticks (&grave;&grave;&grave; &grave;&grave;&grave;).

<u>Example:</u>
````markdown
  Some basic Git commands are:
  ```
  git status
  git add
  git commit
  ```
````

## Links
---
To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets `[]` and the url in parentheses `()`.

<u>Example:</u>
The link to my [website](https://linkaiwu.com)
```markdown
The link to my [website](https://linkaiwu.com)
```

### Relative links
You can link to pages on the same website by including the path in the parentheses `()`.

<u>Example:</u>
Click [me](/) to go to the homepage
```markdown
Click [me](/) to go to the homepage
```

### Section links
This feature is not yet implemented!

## Images
---
You can display an image by adding `!` and wrapping the alt text in `[]`. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses `()`.

<u>Example:</u>
![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
```markdown
![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)`
```

## Lists
---
### Unordered lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-`, `*`, or `+`.


<u>Example:</u>
- George Washington
* John Adams
+ Thomas Jefferson

```markdown
- George Washington
* John Adams
+ Thomas Jefferson
```

### Ordered lists
To order your list, precede each line with a number.

<u>Examples:</u>
> **Using sequential numbers:**
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
```

> **Using all 1's**
1. Red
1. Orange
1. Yellow

```markdown
1. Red
1. Orange
1. Yellow
```

> **Starting with an offset**
69. Orange
1. Banana
1. Strawberry

```markdown
69. Orange
1. Banana
1. Strawberry
```

### Nested lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

<u>Example:</u>
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

```markdown
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

### Task lists
To create a task list, preface unordered list items and space followed by `[ ]`. To mark a task as complete, use `[x]`.

<u>Example:</u>
* [ ] Touch some grass
* [ ] Take out the trash
+ [x] Wash the dishes

```
* [ ] Touch some grass
* [ ] Take out the trash
+ [x] Wash the dishes
```

## Paragraphs
---
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

## Footnotes
---
You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

```markdown
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

Footnotes can be referenced more than once[^2]!

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: A footnote **can have markup**!
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
```

## Horizontal Line
---
Use a triple underscore `___`, dash `---`, or asterisk `***`.

<u>Example:</u>

---
<br/>
---
<br/>
---

```
---
<br/>
---
<br/>
---
```

## Tables
---
You can add tables to your content by using this syntax:

```markdown
| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| myriad | a very large number |
| thwart | to oppose successfully; to prevent, frustrate |
| grudgingly | displaying or reflecting reluctance or unwillingness |
```

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| myriad | a very large number |
| thwart | to oppose successfully; to prevent, frustrate |
| grudgingly | displaying or reflecting reluctance or unwillingness |


## Ignoring Markdown formatting
---
You can tell ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

<u>Example:</u>
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```markdown
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```
